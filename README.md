Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13318? (Findings of EMNLP2025) 

---

## 📖 Introduction
**HapticCap** is a multimodal dataset and benchmark task designed for understanding **user experience of vibration-based haptic signals**.  
It provides a new resource for research at the intersection of **haptics, text, and multimodal learning**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Modality**: Vibration haptic signals, paired with textual annotations  
- **Textual Annotations**:  
  - Sensory: It refers to physical attributes (e.g.,intensity of tapping).
  - Emotional: It refers to emotional denotes affective impressions (e.g., the mood of a scene).
  - Associative: It indicates real-world familiar experiences (e.g., buzzing of a bee, a heartbeat).
 
- **Format**: Signals stored as time-series data; annotations in JSON with haptic signal ID  
- **Scale**:
